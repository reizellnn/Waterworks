<h1 align="center"> Waterworks Monitoring System </h1>

## Project Description
The Rural Waterworks mobile application is a user-friendly and intuitive platform designed to empower users in rural areas to monitor and track their monthly water consumption. It addresses the problem of inefficient water consumption management and detects leaks or instances of water wastage in rural households. Managing water consumption data for a large population in rural areas can be time-consuming and demanding. In line with these features, the application also contributes to SDG 12 of the United Nations, which focuses on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.

To achieve its objectives, the app enables customers to monitor and track their water consumption, providing transparency through access to monthly transactions. It also facilitates the recording and updating of customer consumption data by the staff, streamlining payment handling processes. Through these features, the app contributes to better water management, leak detection, and overall operational effectiveness for the rural waterworks company.
